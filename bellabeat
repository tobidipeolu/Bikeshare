## Finding unique Ids
SELECT Distinct ID
FROM sleeplog

SELECT Distinct ID
FROM dailyactivity

SELECT Distinct ID
FROM weightlog

## Cleaning the Data (IDs are 10 characters)
SELECT 
LENGTH(Id)
FROM dailyactivity
WHERE LENGTH(Id) <> 10;

SELECT 
LENGTH(Id)
FROM sleepday
WHERE LENGTH(Id) <> 10;

SELECT 
LENGTH(Id)
FROM weightlog

## Finding duplicates and removing them
SELECT Id, SleepDay, COUNT(*)
FROM sleeplog
GROUP BY Id, sleepday
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

SELECT Id, ActivityDate, COUNT(*)
FROM dailyactivity
GROUP BY Id, ActivityDate
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

SELECT Id, date, COUNT(*)
FROM weightlog
GROUP BY Id, date
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

### FINDING THE AVERAGE BMI and AVERAGE WEIGHT ( 25.18 (healthy), 158.7)
### Comparing it those that achieve their reccommended steps BMI and weight (25.33, 180.50) 

SELECT
